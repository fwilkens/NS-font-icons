Demonstrates a font issue for certain Android devices. The issue has only presented itself on certain Samsung devices at this time. Some or all icons which would normally appear are not displayed on these devices:

* Samsung Galaxy S8
* Samsung Note 8

To re-create the issue, simply clone down and build the app on one of the above devices (or emulators), then compare to the project when installed on a Google Pixel device/emulator (or really any other Android device).
